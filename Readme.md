# DTM Editor

DTM editor is an editor for the Dolphin TAS Movie format.

It's i18n-friendly and can be translated to other languages. Currently it supports English, French, and Japanese locales.

### Why make this?

Because hex editing gets annoying for me the longer I do it outside of reverse-engineering.

### Does it support Wii controller data?

Not yet. Currently it only supports GameCube controller data. I plan to add support for it.
